<h1>Reusable Services</h1>

We hope to make use of the following fine open source software to help complete  the Geronimo J2EE stack.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://mx4j.sourceforge.net/">MX4J</a> for JMX
</li>
<li>
Apache Tomcat or Jetty for Web Container
</li>
<li>
Apache Axis for Web Services Stack
</li>
<li>
Apache's Jakarta James for email
</li>
<li>
OJB for JDO & plugins to the CMP engine (Hibernate is LGPL - the bindings to Geronimo must be outside of Apache)
</li>
<li>
commons-jndi for JNDI - 
(There is currently a JNDI implementation in Tomcat's CVS. It might be better to 
move this to Jakarta Commons so we can all work & extend it - there are various 
features from Jetty and OpenEjb ?we'd like to add? ). 
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://activemq.codehaus.org/">Codehaus' ActiveMQ</a> for JMS
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jotm.objectweb.org/">ObjectWeb's JOTM</a> for transaction management
</li>
</ul>
