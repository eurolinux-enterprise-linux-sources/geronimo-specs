Documentation
===================
 
 This README serves as five minute overview of Geronimo, but better
 documentation can be found here:
 
   -  http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/Deployment
   -  http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/Running
   
 Those are wiki pages that will be updated as we collect feedback from
 this release.

 O'Reilly has released two chapters of the forthcoming Geronimo Developer's 
 Notebook by David Blevins (O'Reilly 2004-ish) to help Geronimo reach its M2 
 goals and to grow the community.  The chapters are located at:

Release Notes
===================

 Please read the RELEASE_NOTES for a complete list of thinigs that are
 not yet functional.  We wrote those up to save you time trying to get
 things to work we know are not implemented.

Installation
===================

 If you've downloaded and unpacked a binary distrobution of Geronimo,
 then you are finished with installation.  If you downloaded a source
 distrobution, then see the BUILDING.txt file for more instructions
 before continuing any further.
 
___________________
Geronimo Home
===================
 
 The GERONIMO_HOME directory, is the directory where the Geronimo
 binary was unpacked or the it is the 'target' directory created by
 Maven from a source distrobution.
 
 If you unpacked the binary into the directory C:\geronimo,
 for example, than this directory is your GERONIMO_HOME directory.
 The GERONIMO_HOME directory is refered to in various parts of the
 documentation, so it's good to remeber where it is.

___________________
Deploying
===================

 The Geronimo deployment tool is packaged in the executable jar
 bin/deployer.jar under the GERONIMO_HOME and can be executed like
 this:

   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar --install --module myDataSource.rar
   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar --install --module myEJB.jar
   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\deployer.jar --install --module myWebapp.war

 Notice that the deployer.jar is capable of handling a number of
 different archive types; rar, war, and ejb jar.  At this time ear
 archives are not supported.

___________________
Starting
===================

 The main server class is also packed in an executable jar,
 bin/server.jar, and can be ran in a way similar to the deploy tool.

   C:\geronimo> java -jar bin\server.jar  org/apache/geronimo/DebugConsole
   
 I know what you're thinking, "Why does 'bin\server.jar' use
 back-slashes and 'org/apache/geronimo/DebugConsole' use
 forward-slashes?"  The answer is 'org/apache/geronimo/DebugConsole'
 is a URI; a unique identifier that Geronimo uses to find the app you
 want to start.  URI's use forward-slashes only, never back-slashes.
 So, no matter what operating system your on, the URI will always look
 similar to the one above.
